# Retail Insights: Data-Driven Analysis

## Description

Unlock the potential of retail data with this analysis project aimed at understanding customer behavior, sales trends, and optimizing pricing strategies. By using a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and powerful visualizations, this project extracts actionable insights for improving customer engagement, sales forecasting, and decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify high-value customers based on transaction history.
